Denver isn't exactly known for it's well thought out urban planning so if you think it's strange that the first post on this website is about a rail station I wont hold it against you. In fact when I ask most people in Denver if they ever ride the rail lines to get around the city the most common response is, "Denver has a light rail?". What's wild is that Denver's rail transit system is pretty expansive, crossing eight county lines, more than 250 trains, and over a 100 miles of rail. So why is that most people in Denver, at least the ones I talk to, don't really use the rail system? To understand you have to get a sense of the layout of Denver. 

Denver is a sprawl, with the metropolitan area over twice the size of London with about a fifth of the population. Most noteworthy about Denver's configuration is that a majority of people in the Denver MSA don't actually live in Denver proper but rather in the suburbs, places like Aurora, Littleton, Golden, Wheat Ridge, etc. Commutes, therefore, cross from suburbs and the city center or between suburbs themselves. Given the size of the Denver Metropolitan area, walking is out of the question for most commutes, so the city has relied heavily on car commuting since the inception of it's suburban phase, begging in the 1950's with the completion of I-25.

RTD began planning for a rail system [following the completion of the San Diego Trolley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Transportation_District#Light_rail), which had success in linking suburbs with the urban core through a light rail system. After some initial hurdles, RTD received funding and built the initial system of light rails across the metropolitan area. This was later backed by more funding and commuter rail expansions which included a line connecting downtown Denver to the airport, a cool 25 mile ride!, as well as the station you see pictured here, the Westminster station. RTD's vision for rail in Denver was now realized but that vision may be a bit questionable.
